# USING COMPARISON OPERATORS

- At the most basic level, you can evaluate two variables using acomparison operator to return at True or false value. 
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
  set of comparison operators.

# Loops 

- loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code - until a certain condition is met. When developers talk       about iteration or iterating over, say, an array, it is the same as looping

- There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
