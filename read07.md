# BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS 

- **A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe**
- **Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.** 
- **Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.**
- **JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).** 
- **Expressions evaluate into a single value.**
