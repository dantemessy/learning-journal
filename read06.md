# So how do computers actually work?

- How computers work is something that I’ve always been curious about but never actually thought that I was going to have the actual basic knowledge to understand it, even at a high level. So doing the research to write this blog post and finding out that it wasn’t so hard to understand has been very rewarding, plus, getting to understand how computers work, again even at a high level, is pretty mind-blowing.

- **The most basic way of thinking of a computer is as an Input/Output machine.** That’s a pretty basic idea: computers take information from external sources (your keyboard, mouse, sensors or the internet), store it, process it, and return the result (Output) of that process. By the way, if you think about it, the moment computers are connected through the internet there’s an ever ending loop of inputs and outputs as the output of a computer (say a website) becomes the input of another and so forth(!!).
