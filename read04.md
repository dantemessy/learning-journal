# Get Better Site With HTML


PROCESS & Design
- It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page .

IMAGES 
- You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site .
- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.
- You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page. 

HTML5 LAYOUT
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
